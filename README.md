An intelligent, full-stack web application designed to help UK university students track, manage, and predict their academic grades.

## My Problem:
During last year's exam period, I was always anxious about my performance in the final exam. I wanted to know exactly what I needed in my exams and coursework to achieve my targets. <br/> <br/> To find this out myself, required my own calculations. I wanted it to be easy. <br/> <br/>
I didn't have time back then, but now I do. I've created an app that solves everything I need. Currently needs the finishing touches, but if you find it useful, I don't mind you using it either! (Don't make me pay for a database
